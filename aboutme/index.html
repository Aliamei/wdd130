    <p>Hi I lived in Anchorage Alaska until I was 7 years old and then I moved to Seattle, Washtington and have been
        there ever since.</p>
    <p>I served my mission in Houston, Texas. I had a total of 14 companions and was in 6 areas.
    <p>I enjoy swimming, playing volleyball, playing insturments, and hanging out with friends</p>
    <P>The idea of coding has always seemed interesting to me, so I decided to give this a try and I look forward to
        learning more.</p>
